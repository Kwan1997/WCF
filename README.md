# WCF
Codes for reproducing our paper *"WCF: A hybrid similarity model for mitigating the cold-start problem of collaborative filtering in sparse data"*. Run **handler1.py**.

Required Packages:
- **Surprise** (See https://surprise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
- Other Common machine learning packages such as sklearn, etc.

Remarks:
- Movielens-100K and Movielens-1M datasets are built-ins of the **Surprise** package, so I only upload the Yahoo Music dataset.
- For other comparative similarity methods, you may refer to another repository of mine at https://github.com/Kwan1997/rec-similarity.

Warning:
- These codes (including those in my other repository) have bad readability and user experience, and there are many functions that are not used.
