# WCF
Codes for reproducing our paper *"WCF: A hybrid similarity model for mitigating the cold-start problem of collaborative filtering in sparse data"*.

Required Packages:
- **Surprise** (See https://surprise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
- Other Common machine learning packages such as sklearn, etc.

Remark:
- Movielens-100K and Movielens-1M datasets are builted in the **Surprise** package, so I only upload the Yahoo Music dataset.

Warning:
- These codes have bad readability and user experience, and there are many functions that are not used.
